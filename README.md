# GroupMeBot-KelleyHonorsGC
While on a google hangout call with my mentor Allison Arena during the CoronaVirus pandemic, I was inspired to create a group me bot to inspire us during our low times. Project hosted on Heroku, quotes come from a randomly picked csv off the internet, and app written in Python and ran on flask.

#Ambitions
Allison is a Taylor Swift fan. Therefore, I want to build a bot trained on Taylor Swift lyrics. Details coming out soon.
